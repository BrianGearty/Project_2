# Le Marche Francais

It is an online store, yes! One more e-commerce.
Bonjour! Amidst the changes that have affected our lives in the past year we understand that people are apprehensive of going out to the store to shop. Our mission is to bring you locally sourced, organic, good-tasting food...And now, from the comfort of your home. Register your name and email with us to shop our markets full of fresh produce, wines, cheeses, meats and everything else you need then come by and grab your order for a "no contact" pick up.

## Description
What is this app about?
This e-commerce is designed for small stores and small markets that show the products that they have in stock so that users can place their orders and be able to pick them up or require that they be sent to the door of their homes.
